I am Afif, a graduate student at the <a href='https://ucalgary.ca'>University of Calgary</a> and working with <a href='https://casweb.59b0587b.public.multi-containers.ibm.com/ibm/cas/canada/'>IBM CAS Canada</a>. Alongside my studies, I serve as a Graduate Assistant in Research & Teaching at the same institution. My current research centers on Large Language Models and Software Engineering, areas I am deeply passionate about. Before my graduate studies, I worked for several years as a Software Engineer specializing in AI. During this time, I had the opportunity to contribute to various cutting-edge projects across different domains. I was also honored with a gold medal upon receiving my Bachelor of Science degree.<br><br>Like many software engineers, I dream of retiring to a remote village and starting a farm. :)
