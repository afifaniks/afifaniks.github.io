## Abstract

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, maintaining efficiency, quality, and reliability is critical for any project development. Embark on a journey of inspiration as we explore the fusion of AI with Adoptium AQAvit and Openj9. We will dive into visionary AI concepts and initiatives within both projects, illuminating pathways for transformative change â€“ component and issue assignment, duplicate issue detection, issue creation. Moreover, we will explore the tangible benefits and pragmatic implications of infusing AI into AQAvit testing and Openj9 workflows, including accelerated testing and release cycles, heightened fault detection capabilities, and diminished manual workload. Through real-world case studies with CAS and Semesters of Code project, we would like to share our story of how AI can revolutionize testing and triaging, paving the way for more robust and reliable software development practices.
